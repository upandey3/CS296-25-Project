Summary: This game has 25 rooms, 33 commands, 14 objects, state-association with rooms, an interactive puzzle, and
		 various object-dependent obstacles.

Requirements

To be considered complete, your game must have the following:

At least 15 rooms.
At least 15 commands, not including aliases (e.g., n and north and go north all count as one command).
To solve the game, the player must retrieve at least one object that is not obtainable without solving a puzzle of some kind.
At least 10 objects.
Some of the objects and rooms should have state associated with them, i.e., something about them can change as a result of the playerâ€™s actions.
For an extra challenge (but not for extra points), try doing the following:

Have a non-player character that interacts with the player or with the environment.
Support prepositions or noun clauses (e.g., get the key that is under the bed)
